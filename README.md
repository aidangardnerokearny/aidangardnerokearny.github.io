Hey there! I'm Aidan Gardner-O'Kearny, an incoming physics PhD student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I'm interested in high energy experiment, specifically searches for Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics utilizing exotic detector signatures. I'm also interested in the development of a 10 TeV Muon collider.

I worked as a part of the ATLAS Collaboration while I was an undergraduate at the University of Oregon. During my time there I worked on both a long-lived particle search and a search for BSM scalars.
