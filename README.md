# Aidan Gardner-O'Kearny


Hey there! I'm Aidan Gardner-O'Kearny, an incoming physics PhD student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I'm interested in high energy experiment, specifically searches for Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics utilizing exotic detector signatures. I'm also interested in the development of a 10 TeV Muon collider.

I worked as a part of the ATLAS Collaboration while I was an undergraduate at the University of Oregon. During my time there I worked on both a long-lived particle search and a search for BSM scalars.

## [Some Old Work][Pages/SomeOldWork.md]
I try to keep a complete repository of previous work I've done, even if it's no longer something that I would put forward with my name attached. I think that last bit is important. We're always improving, and, if we keep our old work visible rather than hidden it serves as a reminder of that not only to ourselves, but to anyone on the journey themselves.
