# Some Old Work
I try to keep a complete repository of previous work I've done, even if it's no longer something that I would put forward with my name attached. I think that last bit is important. We're always improving, and, if we keep our old work visible rather than hidden it serves as a reminder of that not only to ourselves, but to anyone on the journey themselves.

## Posters
- [Combinatorial Fake Discrimination Studies For Combined dE/dx and Disappearing Track Search](/Documents/AGOSymposiumPoster2025.pdf)
    - May 2025
    - I made this for the 2025 UO Undergraduate Research Symposium, recieving 2nd place in the physics department poster competition
- [Comparing resolved and boosted jet identification algorithms to search for beyond the Standard Model scalar bosons with the ATLAS detector](/Documents/AGOSHbbyyPoster.pdf)
    - August 2024
    - I worked on this while I was a SULI intern at Brookhaven National Lab
- [Background Ionization Behavior For Combined dE/dx And Disappearing Track Analysis](/Documents/AidanGardnerOKearnySymposiumPosterPrintable.pdf)
    - May 2025
    - My first stab at a poster. Very, very wordy. Made for the 2024 UO Undergraduate Research Symposium


## Presentations


## Written Work
- [Combinatorial fake discriminatory selections for combined dE/dx and disappearing track search with the ATLAS detector](/Documents/AGO_HC_Thesis.pdf)
    - June 2025
    - My undergraduate thesis for UO's Clark Honors College. A broad overview of everything I worked on as a part of the $dE/dx$ and disappearing track analysis with ATLAS

- [Comparing resolved and boosted jet identification algorithms to search for beyond the Standard Model scalar bosons with the ATLAS detector](/Documents/AGOSHbbyyReport.pdf)
    - August 2024
    - The report I wrote at the end of my time at Brookhaven National Lab, providing a broad overview of the work I did as a part of the $SH\rightarrow{}\bar{b}b\gamma\gamma$ analysis with ATLAS

## Other Stuff
- [Blackout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssIP8UMuIh0)
    - I was on the editing team for this (as well as having a background role)
    - Editing is hard, especially when you're working with limited footage, and I'm really proud of the final product we managed to pull out of what was available to us
    - We won the audience's choice award at the 2022 film festival hosted by UFO
