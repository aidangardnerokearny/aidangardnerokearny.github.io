# Portfolio

I try to keep a complete repository of previous work I've done, even if it's no longer something that I would put forward with my name attached. I think that last bit is important. We're always improving, and, if we keep our old work visible rather than hidden it serves as a reminder of that not only to ourselves, but to anyone on the journey themselves.
