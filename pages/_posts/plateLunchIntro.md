# Searching for a Good Plate Lunch in Knoxville Tennessee

I spent the summer of 2024 in Long Island, doing some research at Brookhaven National lab. Overall, it was a great experience, I met a ton of cool people, learned a lot of things, and got to be exposed to a US subculture I had never
really seen before. I have some complicated thoughts about that part of New York, but the major one is that there is not a single Hawaiian resturant on that entire stretch of land.
